We have the idea of a vengeful child , which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme , which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie . The plot is basically this : young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother , so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge ( as you do ) . This is all well and good , except for the fact that it 's boring ! Nothing happens for most of the film , and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore ; it 's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it . The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish . There 's really not much I can say about the film overall as there is n't much to it .
